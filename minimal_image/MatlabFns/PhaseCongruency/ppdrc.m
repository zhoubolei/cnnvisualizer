% PPDRC Phase Preserving Dynamic Range Compression
%
% Generates a series of dynamic range compressed images at different scales.
% This function is designed to reveal subtle features within high dynamic range
% images such as aeromagnetic and other potential field grids. Often this kind
% of data is presented using histogram equalisation in conjunction with a
% rainbow colourmap. A problem with histogram equalisation is that the contrast
% amplification of a feature depends on how commonly its data value occurs,
% rather than on the amplitude of the feature itself. In addition, the use of a
% rainbow colourmap can introduce undesirable perceptual distortions.
%
% Phase Preserving Dynamic Range Compression allows subtle features to be
% revealed without these distortions. Perceptually important phase information
% is preserved and the contrast amplification of anomalies in the signal is
% purely a function of their amplitude. It operates as follows: first a highpass
% filter is applied to the data, this controls the desired scale of analysis.
% The 2D analytic signal of the data is then computed to obtain local phase and
% amplitude at each point in the image. The amplitude is attenuated by adding 1
% and then taking its logarithm, the signal is then reconstructed using the
% original phase values.
%
% Usage: dim = ppdrc(im, wavelength, savename, n)
%
% Arguments:      im - Image to be processed (can contain NaNs)
%         wavelength - Array of wavelengths, in pixels, of the  cut-in
%                      frequencies to be used when forming the highpass
%                      versions of the image.
%           savename - (optional) Basename of filname to be used when saving
%                      the output images.  Images are saved as
%                      'basename-n.png' where n is the highpass wavelength
%                      for that image .  You will be prompted to select a
%                      folder to save the images in. 
%                  n - Order of the Butterworth high pass filter.  Defaults
%                      to 2
%
% Returns:       dim - Cell array of the dynamic range reduced images.  If
%                      only one wavelength is specified the image is returned 
%                      directly, and not as a one element cell array.
%
% Note when specifying the array 'wavelength' it is suggested that you use
% wavelengths that increase in a geometric series.  You can use the function
% GEOSERIES to conveniently do this
% 
% Example using GEOSERIES to generate a set of wavelengths that increase
% geometrically in 10 steps from 50 to 800. Output is saved in a series of
% image files called 'result-n.png'
%   dim = compressdynamicrange(im, geoseries([50 800], 10), 'result');
%
% View the output images in the form of an Interactive Image using LINIMIX
